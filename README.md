montyhall simulation

## About  
This is a simulator for the [Monty Hall problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem). It runs multiple attempts of the Monty Hall problem with a strategy of either never changing doors or always changing doors.  
The result of the number of correct guesses and wrong guesses should be printed at the end.  
The probability of guessing correctly should become roughyl 2/3, according to theory.  

## How to Run  
```bash
$ python run_montyhall.py (change_door= y|n) (tries= 1~...)
```
